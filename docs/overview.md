# Overview

Doable is an intelligent, agentic productivity platform that redefines task management. Unlike traditional tools that act as passive containers for to-do lists, Doable utilizes advanced AI to understand the context, motivation, and "Why" behind your tasks.

By integrating psychological profiling (Ikigai) with a dual-backend architecture (Next.js + Python AI Agents), Doable bridges the gap between intent and action.

## Core Value Proposition

-   **Agentic Behavior**: The system doesn't just record tasks; it plans, schedules, and verifies them.
-   **Psychological Context**: Tasks are aligned with user personas and life goals.
-   **Dual-Backend Intelligence**: Combines the speed of Next.js/React with the advanced agentic capabilities of Python/FastMCP.
