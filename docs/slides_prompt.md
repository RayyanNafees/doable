## Slide 2: The Problem
**Title:** The Productivity Paradox
**Content:**
- **Overwhelming Compexity:** Modern professionals juggle multiple tools (Calendar, Jira, Slack, Email).
- **Context Switching:** Converting messages into tasks requires high cognitive load.
- **Lack of "Why":** Task lists often lack alignment with personal goals or psychological motivators.
- **Static Tools:** Traditional tools are passive; they don't "think" or "act" on your behalf.

**Speaker Notes:**
We are drowning in tasks but starving for context. Traditional tools are digital paper; they record but don't assist. We need an agent that acts, not just tracks.
