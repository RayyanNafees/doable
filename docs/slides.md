## Slide 2: The Problem
**Title:** The "Productivity" Paradox
**Content:**
- **Fragmentation:** Users drown in disconnected apps (Slack, Jira, Calendar, Notes).
- **Cognitive Load:** "Managing" tasks takes more energy than *doing* them.
- **Context Blindness:** Dumb tools don't know *why* a task matters or *who* you are.
- **Result:** Burnout and busywork, not flow.

**Speaker Notes:** We have more tools than ever, yet feel less productive. Traditional apps are passive containers. We need an active partner.
